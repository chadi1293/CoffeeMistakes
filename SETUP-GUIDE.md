## üìù REDDIT LAUNCH STRATEGY

### When Your Site is Live...

**Target Subreddit:** r/Coffee (1.8M members)

**Best Posting Time:**
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 8-10am ET or 6-8pm ET
- Avoid Monday mornings and Friday evenings

**Post Title (Pick one):**
1. "I built a quiz to help beginners avoid the $500 mistakes r/Coffee talks about"
2. "Made a free tool to stop people from buying the wrong coffee gear (like I did)"
3. "After seeing the same beginner mistakes for years, I built this equipment quiz"

**Post Body Template:**
```
Hey r/Coffee,

After [lurking/participating] here for [X time] and seeing the same expensive mistakes every week, I built a free quiz to help beginners avoid wasting money.

The Problem:
Every week someone posts "I bought a Breville Barista Express and my shots are sour" or "Should I spend more on machine or grinder?" The advice is always the same, but beginners keep making the same mistakes.

What I Built:
A 2-minute quiz (8 questions) about budget, patience level, space, and current setup. Then gives HONEST equipment recommendations based on what this community actually recommends - not marketing BS.

Example results:
- "Reality Check" - Tells people with low budgets to skip espresso and try AeroPress
- "Smart Starter" - Explains 50/40/10 budget split (grinder/machine/accessories)
- "Troubleshooter" - For people with sour shots, focuses on grinder/beans/water first

Full Transparency:
- Completely free, no email required
- Has Amazon affiliate links (clearly disclosed on every page)
- Option to donate via PayPal if it helps you
- Built in [X hours] because I made these mistakes myself

Would Love Feedback:
- Does this actually help or just add noise?
- What am I missing?
- Too harsh? Not harsh enough?

Site: CoffeeMistakes.com

Happy to answer questions about coffee or the build process!
```

**After Posting:**
- Monitor for first 2-4 hours
- Respond to EVERY comment (even negative ones)
- Be helpful, not defensive
- Take feedback seriously
- Thank people for trying it
